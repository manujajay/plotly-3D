# Plotly 3D

This repository is dedicated to demonstrating how to create 3D visualizations using Plotly in Python. It provides examples of 3D scatter plots, surface plots, and mesh plots, showcasing how to leverage Plotly's powerful and interactive features.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip package manager

## Installation

1. **Install Plotly**:
   ```bash
   pip install plotly
   ```

## Example Usage

### 1. 3D Scatter Plot

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go

trace = go.Scatter3d(
    x=[1, 2, 3],
    y=[4, 5, 6],
    z=[7, 8, 9],
    mode='markers'
)

fig = go.Figure(data=[trace])
fig.show()
```

### 2. 3D Surface Plot

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import numpy as np

x = np.outer(np.linspace(-2, 2, 30), np.ones(30))
y = x.copy().T
z = np.sin(x ** 2 + y ** 2)

fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Surface(z=z, x=x, y=y)])
fig.show()
```

### 3. 3D Mesh Plot

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go

x = [0, 1, 2, 0]
y = [0, 0, 1, 2]
z = [0, 2, 0, 1]

fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Mesh3d(x=x, y=y, z=z)])
fig.show()
```
